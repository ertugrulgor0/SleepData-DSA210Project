# SleepData-DSA210Project

## **Project Overview**  
Ever wondered how daily habits influence sleep? I have too. In this project, I’ll be tracking my **physical activity, nutrition, caffeine intake, and screen time** to analyze their impact on **sleep onset time, duration, and quality**. By collecting and analyzing my own data using data science techniques, I’ll uncover what truly helps—or hinders—my sleep.  

The goal? To move beyond guesswork, identify patterns backed by data, and optimize my habits for better rest and more energized mornings.

## **Objectives**  
1. **Figure Out What Affects My Sleep the Most** – Is it caffeine? Too much screen time? A late-night workout? Let’s find out!  
2. **Uncover the Link Between Exercise and Sleep** – Does working out more help me sleep better, or does it keep me wired?  
3. **See How Food Choices Impact Rest** – Are late-night carbs messing with my sleep? Or does cutting sugar actually help?  
4. **Investigate the Tech Factor** – Is my phone keeping me up at night, or am I just blaming it for my bad habits?  
5. **Use Data to Build the Perfect Nighttime Routine** – No more guessing! I’ll use real insights to optimize my habits and get the best sleep possible.

## **Motivation**  
Sleep is **everything**. It affects my energy, mood, focus, and overall well-being. But with so many things pulling at my attention—late-night Netflix, caffeine, workouts—how do I know what’s really affecting my sleep? Instead of relying on random advice, I want **hard data**.  

This project is personal. I want to stop waking up feeling groggy and start using science to take control of my rest. If I can **pinpoint the habits that improve my sleep**, I can make smarter choices every day—not just for better sleep, but for a better life.

## Hypothesis

**Null Hypothesis (H₀):**  
There is no significant relationship between daily habits (physical activity, nutrition, caffeine intake, and screen time) and sleep quality. Changes in these habits do not significantly affect sleep duration or quality.  

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):**  
There is a significant relationship between daily habits and sleep quality. Variations in physical activity, nutrition, caffeine intake, and screen time have a measurable impact on sleep duration and quality.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project consists of at least one month of daily records. Here’s what I’ll be tracking:

- **Date**: The specific day of the record
- **Exercise Duration (min)**: Total time spent exercising
- **Body Weight (kg)**: Daily body weight measurement
- **Commuting Time (min)**: Time spent walking or traveling
- **Carbohydrates (g)**: Daily carb intake
- **Sugar (g)**: Total sugar consumption
- **Protein (g)**: Amount of protein consumed
- **Caffeine Intake (mg)**: Total caffeine consumed
- **Computer Usage (min)**: Time spent on a computer
- **Phone Usage (min)**: Time spent on a phone
- **Sleep Onset Time**: Time taken to fall asleep
- **Sleep Duration (hrs)**: Total sleep duration
- **Sleep Quality (1-10)**: Self-rated sleep quality

I’ll log all data daily using **Google Sheets or Notion**, ensuring consistency and accuracy. Any outliers due to illness, injuries, or major routine changes will be flagged for review.

## **Tools and Technologies**  
To dig deep into my data, I’ll be using:  

- **Python** – The magic wand for data science!  
- **Pandas** – Cleaning and organizing my messy data.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Making beautiful charts to actually see what’s going on.  
- **SciPy & Statsmodels** – Running stats tests to separate facts from coincidences.

### **Analysis Plan**  
Here’s how I’m going to break it down:  

1. **Collect & Clean Data** – Every day, I’ll log my habits and make sure everything is recorded properly.  
2. **Explore My Data** – I’ll start with some **scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps** to spot trends.  
3. **Run Statistical Tests** – I’ll use **T-tests, ANOVA, and regression models** to see which factors have the biggest impact on my sleep.  
4. **Train a Prediction Model (Maybe!)** – If I have enough data, I’ll build a simple **machine learning model** to predict my sleep quality based on my habits.  
5. **Find the Key Insights & Make Adjustments** – I’ll take everything I learn and tweak my daily routine to improve my sleep!

### **Conclusion**  
By the end of this project, I’ll have **real data-backed answers** about my sleep. I’ll know exactly what **helps** me get better rest and what **hurts** it. No more random guessing—just **clear, data-driven strategies** for waking up feeling refreshed and ready to go!  

This isn’t just about sleep—it’s about **understanding how my daily choices impact my life** and using data to make smarter, healthier decisions.
